          <p class="home";>Miller's Pizza is a family owned pizza joint that has been around for centuries.
              Randall W. Miller created the first ever pizza brick and mortor in 1492.  That's right,
               the same exact year that Columbus sailed the ocean blue.  What they don't tell you in that story,
               is that's when the pizza gene was also brought to North America.  Randall W. Miller snuck onto the
               Mayflower with his famous (but secret) pizza dough rescipe, and he never looked back.  500+ years from then
               and we are still keeping it in the family from the very same building he built way back then.  Miller's
               Pizza keeps it in the Family, and that's what you are to us.
